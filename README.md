## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have NodeJS installed on your local machine, i think you need a terminal too

### Installation

clone

```
 git clone https://github.com/Victorola-coder/Auth-flow.git

```

```
cd Auth-flow

```

There are two branches on this repo, just checkout to the react-js branch

```
git checkout react-js
```

You can now install dependencies

```
npm i

```

## Usage

check out each code for how it works
Im using Browser-Router from react-router-dom for the routing in each pages.

## Authentication Flow

This is just a Login/SignUp page and if there is a dashboard or something, it does the redirection

- you need to do state management ans stuffs and its an advanced concept and we can look into that later
